## Usage Examples

### Basic Playing
1. Click on the keyboard keys or use your computer keyboard
2. Adjust the filter cutoff for different tonal colors
3. Modify the envelope settings to change how notes start and end

### Sound Design
1. **Creating a Lead Sound**:
   - Set waveform to Sawtooth
   - Increase filter cutoff (3000+)
   - Add some resonance (10-15)
   - Quick attack, medium release

2. **Creating a Bass Sound**:
   - Set waveform to Square
   - Lower filter cutoff (800-1200)
   - Increase resonance (15-20)
   - Very quick attack, short release

3. **Creating a Pad Sound**:
   - Set waveform to Triangle
   - Moderate filter cutoff (1500-2000)
   - Long attack and release times
   - Add reverb for space

### Key Classes
- `MicroKorgSynth`: Main synthesizer class handling audio generation
- Audio nodes: Oscillator, Filter, Delay, Reverb, Master Gain

### Adding New Features
The synthesizer is designed to be extensible. You can easily add:
- New waveforms
- Additional effects
- More presets
- Extended keyboard range
- MIDI support
